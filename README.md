# WWT Kernel Data Relay

<!--pypi-begin-->
[wwt_kernel_data_relay] is a [Jupyter server extension][ext] that enables
[Jupyter kernels][kernels] to publish some of their data files to the Web; that
is, to request that the Jupyter HTTP server make them accessible at a
predictable URL. This functionality is used by [pywwt], the [AAS] [WorldWide
Telescope] Python library, to expose kernel-side data assets for visualization
inside the WWT [research app][rapp].
